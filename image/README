This directory contains scripts that can build various VMMaker and Spur images.
As of 2018 the default VMMaker build scripts are
	buildspurtrunkvmmaker64image.sh
	buildspurtrunkvmmakerimage.sh
which build Spur64VMMaker.image or SpurVMMaker.image respectively.

The buildspurtrunkreader64image.sh & buildspurtrunkreader.sh scripts build a
Spur image containing a simple REPL that is convenient for testing in the
simulator, called spurreader-64.image or spurreader.image respectively.

The scripts take a -vm argument.  If there is no -vm argument they try and
download a VM from bintray.  If this process fails you can build your own
vm (see the build directories in trhe parent directory, and the HowToBuild
files within them) and supply the executable as the argument to -vm.
