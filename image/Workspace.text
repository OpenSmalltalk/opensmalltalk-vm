This image is a Cog VM development image.  It can be used to build new CoInterpreter or StackInterpreter Cog VMs, and a Newspeak VM, and to run the Cog VM simulator (see the VM Simulation Workspace).The following doit offers a menu of configurations that create a single source tree (../src) for all platforms.  Since they use a relative path they will work out of the box.  Generate the entire VM using them.  Choose Squeak Cog VM by default, and when prompted choose CoInterpreter.	VMMaker generateConfiguration	VMMaker generateAllConfigurationsUnderVersionControlThese items, and some convenient multi-window browser configurations have been added to the "do..." menu for your convenience.To rebuild this image run buildspurtrunkvmmakerimage.sh.Read the class comments of StackInterpreterSimulator and CogVMSimulator for running the simulator, and/or look at the examples in the VM Simulation Workspace.This is useful for forcing the generation of a set of plugins to the default directory:(| plugins | plugins := #(ThreadedARMFFIPlugin ThreadedIA32FFIPlugin). plugins do: [:pluginName| (Smalltalk classNamed: pluginName) touch]. (VMMaker	makerFor: StackInterpreter	and: nil with: #()	to: VMMaker sourceTree, '/src'	platformDir: VMMaker sourceTree, '/platforms'	including: plugins) generateExternalPlugins)
