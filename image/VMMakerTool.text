This image encapsulates the steps required to set up a StandardVMMaker image as described here: http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/6177Step 1. Generate the sources using VMMakerTool.  In the big green window labeled VMMaker  click the load button.  In the file selector, look for *.config files (example vm_standard_PLATFORM_min.config) this will configure the tool for that configuration.  Next to the 'Generate' Label, click the 'Entire' button to generate the sources.  (N.B. VMMakerTool is a front-end to VMMaker. As you gain experience, you will probably find it easier to utilize scripts rather than the GUI)  Read the class comments for more info: VMMakerTool browseStep 2. compile the sources Exit Squeak and create install directory, configure,make,make-install cd ~/..Cog/image/standardVMMaker/Squeak-4.5-All-in-One.app/Contents/Resources/build ../platforms/unix/cmake/configure –help mkdir ~/where/I/want/the/new/vm/executable/to/be/installed, your path is your preference used in –prefix= below ../platforms/unix/cmake/configure --prefix=~/usr/local/standardVM32/ --src=../trunk/src/  --without-gl make make install
