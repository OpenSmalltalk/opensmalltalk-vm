This directory contains scripts that can buld various VMMaker and Spur images.
As of early 2015 the default VMMaker build script is
	buildspurtrunkvmmakerimage.sh
and it builds a Spur VMMaker image, called SpurVMMaker.image.
The buildspurtrunkreader.sh script builds a Spur image containing a simple REPL
that is convenient for testing in the simulator, called spurreader.image.

The standard Cog VMMaker image is built loading the latest VMMaker.oscog and Cog
packages, plus support packages, into an updated Squeak Spur trunk image.
Once you start-up the image various workspaces contain useful expressions to
run the simulator, test slang output and so on.  The "do..." menu off the main
screen menu also contains expressions to generate VM sources.
