buildsqueakcmakeimage.sh is a newbie friendly script that downloads and configures either a Cog VMMaker image or a StandardVMMaker image that is completely configured  for the end user to get productive quickly.
While the image is set up for CMake, the existing GNU build infrastructure is maintained.

If by chance you have not already done so, 

svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog will download the source tree containing this file; it exists as Cog/image/README.buildsqueakcmakimage

Requirements to run the script are:

svn
wget
zip
rsync


From withing the COG/image directory run buildsqueakcmakeimage.sh (buildsqueakcmakeimage.sh -h  for usage)

For Cog installation, the script then 
 downloads the appropriate squeak platform and creates CogVMMaker.image/changes and StandardVMMaker.image/changes for the Cog and Standard Interpreter respectively
 installs the necessary Smalltalk classes on both images.
 rsyncs the parent Cog directory as a sub-tree of the Squeak installation for use by CogVMMaker.image  to an appropriate subdirectory for the version of Squeak. 
 The rsynced copy of the Cog svn source  is then populated with a parallel cmake_xyzbuild tree where the cmake build artifacts are installed (without breaking the existing gnu build stuff)


To view/run your cog build system change directory to Cog/image/cogVMMaker/Squeak---.app/ and run squeakCogVMMaker.sh
The source and build directories are in Cog/image/cogVMMaker/Squeak---.app/Contents/Resources/oscogvm/
The cmake specific build directories are created by the script and are prefaces with 'cmake_'. This was done to avoid cluttering the existing GNU build system.
After generating your build, change directory to your build directory (example: cd oscogvm/cmake_stackbuild/unixbuild/bld/) and invoke build.sh to launch cmake.

After compilation, output files are stored in oscogvm/results




When the Standard Interpreter, no special build tree is created. The system is just set up for use as-is described at http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/6177
to view/run your standard build system cd to Cog/image/standardVMMaker/
