Overview
--------

These are some notes on building the OpenSmalltalk VM on Oracle Solaris 11.

To build,

  cd build.sunosamd64
  cd squeak.cog.spur
  cd build
  ./mvm or ./mvm INSTALLDIR

This will build and install into INSTALLDIR.
The default value for INSTALLDIR is products/squeak.cog.spur-sunosamd64.

To run the vm, consider running the process in the RT (real-time) class.
 
For Solaris specific suggestions please contact me David Stes (stes@telenet.be),
or the OpenSmalltalk team for general OpenSmalltalk issues.

Real-Time
---------

When running the squeak vm, after copying a Squeak .image and .change file,
and after copying the Squeak Smalltalk source file (SqueakV50.sources).

bash-4.4$ bin/squeak Squeak6.0alpha-19547-32bit.image 
pthread_setschedparam failed: Not owner

Note that it is possible to suppress the "pthread_setschedparam" warning,
by running the squeak vm in the RT (real-time) class.

One way would be to use priocntl -e and execute the squeak in the -c RT class.

Or perhaps at the "authorization" (auths) level it could perhaps
be possible to have an entry in /etc/security/exec_attr.d for
an authorization that gives "proc_priocntl" to squeak.

You must do this as "root".

Another way is to change a "bash" shell to RT class,

bash-4.4$ priocntl -d $$
INTERACTIVE CLASS PROCESSES:
   PID[/LWP]       IAUPRILIM     IAUPRI     IAMODE
   4026                0            0          1

bash-4.4$ sudo priocntl -c RT -p 0 -s $$

bash-4.4$ priocntl -d $$
REAL TIME PROCESSES:
   PID[/LWP]         RTPRI       TQNTM      TQSIG
   3966                0          1000         0

After changing the "bash" shell to the RT class, you can launch

bash-4.4$ bin/squeak Squeak6.0alpha-19547-32bit.image

It will inherit the RT class and the pthread_setschedparam warning is gone.

Verify as follows the squeak threads (LWP light-weight processes)

bash-4.4$ ps -eLo pid,pri,lwp,class,comm | grep squeak
 4029 100      1   RT bin/../lib/squeak/5.0-202003240214-solaris/squeak
 4029 101      2   RT bin/../lib/squeak/5.0-202003240214-solaris/squeak

Note that one thread is running in priority 101 and another in priority 100.

Swapspace
---------

Make sure there is sufficient free space in /tmp, mounted on swap in Solaris.
The C compiler may use a lot of space for temporary files under /tmp.

For example (the example 8G is what I use) :

$ df -h /tmp
Filesystem             Size   Used  Available Capacity  Mounted on
swap                   8.2G    78M       8.1G     1%    /tmp

If required, increase the "volsize" of the rpool/swap volume :

# zfs get volsize rpool/swap
NAME        PROPERTY  VALUE  SOURCE
rpool/swap  volsize   8G     local

The command to increase the size is:

# zpool list rpool (check FREE space)
# zfs set volsize=8G rpool/swap

This can be done online, but a reboot is not a bad idea after doing this.

C Compiler
----------

As C compiler we use the Sun C compiler:

$ /opt/developerstudio12.6/bin/cc  -V
cc: Studio 12.6 Sun C 5.15 SunOS_i386 2017/05/30

This is the developer/developerstudio-126/cc (solarisstudio) package.

GNU Make
--------

For the Makefiles, pkg:/developer/build/gnu-make  must be installed.
