Freetype 2.9.1 release is broken for Windows CMake build.
It was fixed two commits later but not re-released.
This patch cherry-picks the fix from http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/commit/?id=660afb5
Next time Freetype is updated, remove this from build.win*/third-party/Makefile.freetype2

Upstream bug report https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=54846
says "CMake fails to install on Windows - Don't worry, it's not your fault. I broke
it myself and found out after the release, but didn't bug Werner to release a 2.9.1.1"
