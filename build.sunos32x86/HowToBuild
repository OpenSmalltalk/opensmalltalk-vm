Overview
--------

These are some notes on building the OpenSmalltalk VM on Oracle Solaris 11.

To build,

  cd build.sunos32x86
  cd squeak.cog.spur
  cd build
  ./mvm or ./mvm INSTALLDIR

This will build and install into INSTALLDIR.
The default value for INSTALLDIR is products/sqcogspursunos[ht]/usr

To run the vm, consider running the process in the RT (real-time) class.
 
For Solaris specific suggestions please contact me David Stes (stes@telenet.be),
or the OpenSmalltalk team for general OpenSmalltalk issues.

Also please see the "HowToBuild" document in the build.sunos64x64 directory.
