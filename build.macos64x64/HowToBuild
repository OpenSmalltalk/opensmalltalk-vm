Overview
--------
The "Cog" VM comes in a bewildering variety of forms.  The first distinction
is between Squeak/Croquet VMs that run Squeak, Pharo, Cuis, Croquet images
and their ilk, and between Newspeak VMs that run Newspeak.

Another distinction is between Stack, Cog and Sista VMs.  Stack VMs are those
with context-to-stack mapping that optimise message sending by keeping method
actications on a stack instead of in contexts.  These are pure interpreters but
significantly faster than the standard context-based Interpreter VM.  Cog VMs
add a JIT to the mix, compiling methods used more than once to maxchine code on
the fly.  Sista VMs, as yet unrealised and in development, add support for
adaptive optimization that does speculative inlining at the bytecode-to-bytecode
level.  These are targeted for release in 2015.

Another distinction is between "v3" VMs and Spur VMs.  "v3" is the original
object representation for Squeak as described in the back-to-the-future paper.
Spur, as described on the www.mirandabanda.org blog, is a faster object
representation which uses generation scavenging, lazy forwarding for fast
become, and a single object header format common to 32 and 64 bit versions.
Newspeak, Squeak 5 and the upcoming release of Pharo all use Spur.

Another distinction is between normal single-threaded VMs that schedule "green"
Smalltalk processes above a single-threaded VM, and "multi-threaded" VMs that
share the VM between any number of native threads such that only one native
thread owns the VM at any one time, switching between threads on FFI calls and
callbacks or on Smalltalk process switches when Smalltalk processes are owned
by threads.  This multi-threaded support is as yet experimental.

The final distinction is between production, assert and debug VMs.  Production
VMs are fully optimized, although they may include debugging symbols, and as
their name implies are for use in production.  Assert and debug VMs include
many assert checks that are disabled in the production VMs.  These asserts are
very helpful in debugging VM problems but significantly impact performance.
The difference between assert and debug VMs is that assert VMs are compiled
with moderate optimization, which improves the performance of the asserts,
whereas debug VMs are compiled with no optimization at all, providing maximum
debuggability with minimum performance.

This directory tree provides build directories for some of this matrix.  For
example, squeak.cog.v3 contains a build directory for Smalltalk Cog VMs using
the old object representation, newspeak.stack.spur contains a build directory
for Newspeak Stack VMs using the Spur object representation.  Build as desired.


Checking out sources to build out-of-the-box
--------------------------------------------
Check-out the repository from github:
	git clone http://www.github.com/OpenSmalltalk/opensmalltalk-vm oscogvm
	cd ./oscogvm
	more README.md


Building out of the box
-----------------------
0. The build system is based on Gnu Make for makefiles, and Xcode.app for
compilers and libraries.  You will need a Mac OS X machine running at least
10.7.x (the author is currently using 10.9) and Xcode v6 or later.  The system
builds only the new Cocoa based VMs that use the platforms/iOS tree.  The old
Carbon-based VMs using platforms/Mac OS are unsupported.

1. Install the tools (Xcode etc).  If you want to sign the application make sure
you have installed a suitable certificate via Keychain Access and that the
signing identity is in the SIGNING_IDENTITY environment variable, e.g. in the
author's .profile is the line
export SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Eliot Miranda"

1a. If you're doing a build in a headless context, e.g. logged in via ssh, then
codesign may fail as it cannot ask for permission.  In this case you'll need to
manually grant permission via
	security -v unlock-keychain [-p <PASSWORD>] /Users/$USER/Library/Keychains/login.keychain
where PASSWORD and ME are replaced by suitable values.
Similarly one may be denied access to an executable when debugging with the lldb
symptom "attach failed: lost connection" or some such.  Use
	/usr/sbin/DevToolsSecurity --enable
to fix this.

2. cd to the VM configuration of your choice and run the mvm script, e.g.
	cd buiild.macos64x64/squeak.cog.spur
	./mvm -A
	
This will build CocoaFast.app, CocoaDebug.app and CocoaAssert.app applications
(or maybe Squeak.app, SqueakAssert.app, SqueakDebug.app, Pharo.app,
 PharoAssert.app, PharoDebug.app, etc) containing the three VM configurations.
If the configuration includes the multi-threaded VM you can use mvm -S to make
the single-threaded VMs, mvm -T to make the multi-threadeds in FastMT.app et al,
and mvm -A to make them all.  mvm -d will make the Debug.app VM, etc.  mvm -?
provides the gory details.

In order to only build the production vm, you can launch the command:
	./mvm -f

Each build directory contains three files
	plugins.int
	plugins.ext
Editing these and making is all one needs to do to change the set of plugins.
But see The Structure of the Makefiles below for "complicated" plugins.


The Structure of the Makefiles
------------------------------
Each VM build directory contains the mvm script, a root Makefile that selects
the VM source to build, plugins.int to specify the internal plugins to build,
and plugins.ext to specify the external plugins (if any) to build.  The root
Makefile then includes a full Makefile from the common directory.  For example,
squeak.cog.spur's Makefile (minus commentary) reads
	----8<-----build.macos64x64/squeak.cog.spur/Makefile----8<---------------
	VMSRCDIR:= ../../spursrc/vm
	SOURCEFILE:=SqueakV50.sources

	include ../common/Makefile.app.squeak.cog
	----8<-----build.macos64x64/squeak.cog.spur/Makefile----8<---------------
Some external plugins require spport libraries.  In particular, the processor
simulators used by VMMaker.oscog to develop the VM JITs, depend on C or C++
code that implements a processor simulator.  See below.  Plugins that require
extra support or special compilation have makefiles under
platforms/iOS/plugins/, for example plugins/iOS/plugins/RePlugin/Makefile.
This Makefile sets some values and then includes common/Makefile.plugin to do
the dirty work.  If you add an exotic plugin that requires such source please
read the plugin makefile build.macos64x64/common/Makefile.plugin and the
makefiles under plugins/iOS/plugins for examples of the facilities available.

The files in build.macos64x64/common are
	Makefile.app
		The top-level makefile for CocoaFast.app et al.
		It includes Makefile.vm to build the vm and plugins and then constructs
		and optionally signs the .app bundle.  It may also install a Smalltalk
		source file.
	Makefile.app.newspeak
		Modifies Makefile.app to rename the executable and install sources
	Makefile.app.squeak.cog
		Modifies Makefile.app to use the green VM icon that implies Cog
	Makefile.flags
		Defines the compilation flags and SDK to use in building the VM
	Makefile.plugin
		Makes either an internal FooPlugin.lib or an external FooPlugin.bundle.
		If platforms/iOS/plugins/FooPlugin/Makefile exists Makefile.vm will
		use it, and it should include Makefile.plugin to do the dirty work.
	Makefile.rules
		Defines the rules for compiling c, c++ and objective-c source files,
		including maintaining dependency information.
	Makefile.vm
		Makes the VM executable in the chosen configuration from product,
		assert or debug.  Decodes plugins.int and plugins.ext and invokes
		make with the relevant makefile, either a special one such as
		platforms/iOS/plugins/RePlugin/Makefile or Makefile.plugin, for each
		internal or external plugin.
	mkNamedPrims.sh
		This script makes sqNamedPrims.h which defines the exports from the set
		of internal plugins that the VM uses to access the primitives in
		internal plugins.


SDKs and Problems
-----------------
The makefiles will use the oldest available SDK that is installed that is new
enough to build the system.  The 64-bit build requires at least the 10.10 SDK.
SDKs are installed in
	/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/
To obtain SDKs one way is to web search for "obtaining older sdks for Xcode",
and follow the instructions you find.  But a more convenient place, at time of
writing, is
	git clone https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs.git

On Sierra people have reported that the support libraries for the SSLPlugin
(libssl.dylib and libcrypto.dylib) are missing.  The symptom is an error
message such as this in the output (and the LOG file produced) of the make:

ld: library not found for -lssl
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make[1]: *** [build/vm/SqueakSSL.bundle/Contents/MacOS/SqueakSSL] Error 1

These libraries should be in the /usr/lib directory for the SDK being used.  Use

make print-sdks

to print the SDK, which might be e.g. /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk.
Libraries would then be found in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk/usr/lib.
If they, or any other Apple support libraries, are missing, locate them (they
may be in /usr/lib) and copy or link them into the SDK /usr/lib and retry the
build.


Signing Problems
----------------
The makefiles will attempt to sign the VM .app bundles that are built iff the
environment variable SIGNING_IDENTITY is set (see "Building out of the box"
above).  codesign, the Xcode utility for signing, may fail if Keychain Access
is not set-up properly.  If you're logging in remotely, e.g. via ssh, and get
an "User interaction is not allowed." error then see
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20205162/user-interaction-is-not-allowed-trying-to-sign-an-osx-app-using-codesign
	"Login your build user via the GUI and open Keychain Access. Select your signing private key, right-click, choose Get Info, change to the Access Control tab and select the "Allow all applications to access this item"."


Building the VM Simulator Support Libraries
-------------------------------------------
If you want to get the Cog VM simulator working you'll need to build one or more
of the processor simulator plugins, each of which has support libraries that
must be built:
	Processor   Plugin           Support Library
	x86         BochsIA32Plugin  build.linux32x86/bochsx86
	x86_64/x64  BochsX64Plugin   build.linux32x86/bochsx64
	ARMv5       GdbARMPlugin     build.linux32x86/gdbarm32
cd to the relevant directories; run conf.COG and then the build script, e.g.
  $ cd build.linux32x86/bochsx86
  $ ./conf.COG
  $ ./makeem

Then when Squeak VMs are built they will include the plugin(s) for which support
libraries have been provided.


Using Different Compilers
-------------------------
The build system uses Xcode's default compiler, clang by default.
You may want to use a different compiler.  Users claim this is possible.
For example, to install gcc 5.2 see
	http://hamelot.co.uk/programming/add-gcc-compiler-to-xcode-6/
(Thanks Hammad!).  There are no guarantees that this will work, but that's the
best pointer I've found.


Compilers To Avoid
------------------
Xcode 9.3.1 produces a broken VM on 64 bits.  We suggest that you avoid
Xcode v9.3.x. 9.3.x ships with Apple LLVM version 9.1.0 (clang-902.0.39.1).
See e.g. https://gist.github.com/yamaya/2924292


Installing third-party libraries
--------------------------------
The Pharo VM depends on a number of third-party libraries.  cmake is needed to
build the libraries.  Pre-compiled binaries for cmake can be downloaded from
https://cmake.org/download.  Once e.g. /Applications/CMake.app is installed,
ensure /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin is in PATH.


Debugging with lldb
-------------------
As described in "Building out of the box" above, there are three kinds of VM
built, the production one with full optimization, the assert VM with -O1, and
the debug one with -O0.  All are debuggable, including ful symbols, but the
production one is less debuggable because of optimization.  To debug via lldb
simply run lldb on the executable in the MacOS directory in the .app bundle,
e.g. if in the image directory you might do
	lldb ../build.macos64x64/pharo.cog.spur/PharoAssert.app/Contents/MacOS/Pharo
The VM includes many functions intended for VM debugging.  See e.g. functions
beginning with print in the main VM source (e.g. spursrc/vm/gcc3x-cointerp.c).
