How to Build a Croquet Cog Stack VM on Mac OS X
--------------------------------
1. Install the tools (xcode etc);  the CoreVM.xcodeproj is set-up to build
   using gcc 4.2 but you can optionally install the Intel C++ compiler 11.1
   and change the compilerSpec in CoreVM.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj to get
   better performance.

2. Check out the following sources from svn (if you haven't already - if you're
   reading this in macbuild its likely you've already got the sources)
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/platforms
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/src
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/macbuild

3. Open a shell, cd into ROOT/macbuild directory and execute either
     ./makevm
  or
     mvm -A
  mvm is a convenience wrapper around makevm that will build different versions
  (DeploymentSymbols, Debug, etc) and collect compiler output to log files.

4. At the end of this process you should have a brand new Croquet.app in the
   macbuild folder (or Fast.app Assert.app and Debug.app if you've used mvm).

N.B. The plugin set is defined by plugins.ext and plugins.int in the build dir.
