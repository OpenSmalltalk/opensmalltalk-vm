How to build the Newspeak VM on Unix
-------------------------------
1. Install the tools (gcc, X11-devel, etc (e.g. libpng, libX11 & libxt source))
2. Check out the following sources from svn (if you haven't already - if you're
   reading this in unixbuild its likely you've already got the sources)
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/platforms
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/spurstacksrc
     svn co http://www.squeakvm.org/svn/squeak/branches/Cog/spurstackbuild
3. Open a shell, cd into the spurstackbuild/unixbuild/bld directory and execute
   the mvm script.  This installs a VM in the sslinux  directory alongside
   spurstacksrc et al.  Alternatively you can configure your own VM, e.g. with
     ../../../platforms/unix/config/configure --with-src=spurstacksrc CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DNDEBUG -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DDEBUGVM=0" LIBS="-lpthread -luuid" LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,now
     make install prefix=WhereYouWantTheVmToGo

	N.B.  On Ubuntu *do not* supply "LIBS="-lpthread -luuid"", i.e. use
     ../../../platforms/unix/config/configure --with-src=spurstacksrc CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DNDEBUG -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DDEBUGVM=0" LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,now

4. At the end of it you'll get a new VM in sslinux, or in the path provided
   via -prefix

N.B. The plugin set is defined by plugins.ext and plugins.int in the build dir.


3a. For an assert-enabled VM use the astbld directory's mvm and find a vm in
    sslinuxast, or do
     ../../../platforms/unix/config/configure --with-src=spurstacksrc CFLAGS="-g -O1 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DDEBUGVM=0 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer" LIBS="-lpthread -luuid" LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,now

3b. For a full debug VM use the dbgbld's mvm and find a vm in sslinuxdbg,
    or do
	CFLAGS="-g -O0 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DDEBUGVM=1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer" LIBS="-lpthread -luuid" LDFLAGS=-Wl,-z,now

3c. If you're building the VM on a 64-bit OS, you'll need a compiler which can
compile and link to 32-bit binaries. On most Linuxes the gcc-multilib package
provides the 32-bit compiler and the ia32-libs provides the 32-bit libraries.
You'll also have to add the -m32 switch to all gcc & g++ invocations.  The
easiest way to do this is to add CC="gcc -m32" & CXX="g++ -m32" to the configure
script:
     ../../../platforms/unix/config/configure CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32" --with-src=spurstacksrc CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msse2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DNDEBUG -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1" LIBS="-lpthread -luuid"
To run a 32-bit VM on a 64-bit OS, you'll also need the 32-bit libraries
provided by the ia32-libs package.

Compiling in 32-bit mode on a 64-bit linux
-------------------------------
Follow 3c. above.  Also note that according to Paul DeBruicker the following
packages need to be installed to compile in 32-bt mode on 64-bit ubuntu.  YMMV.

build-essential
ia32-libs
gcc-multilib
g++multilib

In addition phil@highoctane.be installed libc6dev-i386.

This in itself may not be enough, but persistence will pay off.  See for example
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.smalltalk.pharo.devel/75198.

Testing an external plugin has completely linked
-------------------------------
You may find that an external plugin compiles and links but does not load.
This is usually because it contans undefined symbols.  To find undefined
symbols, remake the plugin, capturing the link step and then supply
	-Wl,--warn-unresolved-symbols -Wl,--no-allow-shlib-undefined
when manually repeating the link command


Optimization level and gcc version
----------------------------------
There are issues with gcc version > 4.2.1.  Any of the following flags may break the build at -O2:
-ftree-pre
-fpartial-inlining
-fcaller-saves

So turn them off.  e.g.
     ../../platforms/unix/config/configure --without-npsqueak CFLAGS="-g -O2 -msse2 -fno-caller-saves -fno-partial-inlining -fno-tree-pre -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DNDEBUG -DNO_VM_PROFILE=1 -DCOGMTVM=0 -DDEBUGVM=0" LIBS=-lpthread
See http://smallissimo.blogspot.fr/2013/02/compiling-squeak-cog-virtual-machine-on.html

There appear to be issues with 3.4.x gcc version on RedHat.  In particular
compiling the Newspeak VM with either of
	gcc version 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-3)
	gcc version 3.4.6 20060404 (Red Hat 3.4.6-10)
using -O2 results in a VM that segfaults early in startup.  For these compilers
it is probably wise to use -O1, even though -O3 seems to work.
