Description: IA-32 Emulator Project
 Bochs is a highly portable open source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator written in C++,
 that runs on most popular platforms. It includes emulation of the Intel x86
 CPU, common I/O devices, and a custom BIOS. Currently, bochs can be compiled
 to emulate a 386, 486 or Pentium CPU. Bochs is capable of running most
 Operating Systems inside the emulation including Linux, Windows 95, DOS,
 and recently Windows NT 4.
