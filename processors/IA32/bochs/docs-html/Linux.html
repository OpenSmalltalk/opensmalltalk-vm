<H1>Instructions for installing RedHat 5.0 for use with bochs.</H1>

<PRE>
First, you need to have the RedHat 5.0 installation CD
and the boot & supplementary floppy disks.  Installing
Linux from other vendors is also possible, but I assume
you have RedHat 5.0 for the script file, and for these
instructions.

Second, you need a real Linux system to create the
disk image file, for use with bochs.  This can be
later transfered to another platform.

Third, you should have already configured/compiled
bochs on your target platform.

# This section done on your Linux system #

Copy both boot & supplementary floppy disks to image files.

  # stick in Boot disk
  linux-> cp /dev/fd0 1.44_redhat_boot
  # stick in Supplementary disk
  linux-> cp /dev/fd0 1.44_redhat_sup

Mount your RedHat 5.0 CD.  The mountpoint and instructions
may be different for your system.

  linux-root> mount /mnt/cdrom

Now edit the install script in bochs-YYMMDD/misc, called
'install_redhat50'.  It has a small section of configurable
parameters you can edit.  Then run it as root.  Make sure
you are in the directory.

  linux-root> cd bochs-YYMMDD/misc
  linux-root> ./install_redhat50

If this went well, then you're hard disk image file
is prepared for you, and has a small set of packages
from the RedHat 5.0 CD on it.  You may add more later,
using the script file as an example.

If you have a target system, different from you
original Linux system, transfer over the 2 floppy
image files, and the hard disk image file now.

Copy the boot floppy image to your working file

  unix-> cp 1.44_redhat_boot 1.44

Point your floppya directive to this working file

  [edit .bochsrc]

Boot bochs from the floppy

  unix-> bochs boot:a

The Welcom To Red Hat Linux screen appears.  At the
boot: prompt, enter 'rescue' and [Return]

  boot:  rescue [Return]

The Color Choices menu appears
press [Return] to take the default

The Keyboard Type menu appears
press [Return] to take the default

The Second Floppy menu appears
Copy the Supplementary floppy image to your working file

  unix-> cp 1.44_redhat_sup 1.44

Type [Return] to let the install program know you inserted
the new floppy.

The SCSI Configuration menu appears
Type [Return] to accept No.

You will now be at the Linux root prompt '#'.
Make an empty directory to mount the hard drive over.
Then mount the hard drive.  I didn't use any partitions
for this example, so use 'hda', not 'hda1'.

  # mkdir /mnt
  # mount -t ext2 /dev/hda /mnt

Run lilo, so you can boot from the hard disk.  Then
unmount the hard drive.

  # /mnt/sbin/lilo -r /mnt
  # umount /mnt

Bomb out of bochs, by clicking on the Power button.  Now
fire up bochs again, booting from the hard drive.

  unix-> bochs boot:c

You can type [Return] at the LILO prompt:

  LILO boot: [Return]

At the login prompt, login as root.  For kicks, try
compiling the sample "hello.cc" program I included.
It should already be in your /root directory, ready
to be compiled.

  [root@bochs /root]# gcc -c hello.cc
  [root@bochs /root]# ./a.out

When you're ready to shutdown Linux, you can
shutdown as normal:

  [root@bochs /root]# shutdown -h now

Enjoy,
-Kevin
