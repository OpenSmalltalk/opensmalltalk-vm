.SH OPTIONS
.LP
When you run bochs without one of the following options, it
will search for a configuration file called .bochsrc in
the current directory and your home directory and display
the start menu.
.TP
.BI \-q
With this option the start menu will be skipped after loading
the configuration file.
.TP
.BI \-f\ configfile
This option specifies the name of the configuration file.
.TP
.BI \-qf\ configfile
When you run bochs with this option, it will skip the start
menu and use the specified configuration file.
.TP
.BI \-n
With this option bochs doesn't load a configuration file.
In that case the setup for the emulation must be done with
bochsrc options on the command line or in the start menu.
.TP
.BI \-h,\ --help
Print a summary of the command line options for bochs and exit.
.LP
You can override the settings from the configuration file
with command line arguments, using the  same  syntax  as the
bochsrc file. If you have  any spaces in your command line
arguments, they should be enclosed  in  single quotes.
For information on Bochs command line and configuration
file arguments, see the man page
.B bochsrc(5).

Example:
  bochs -q 'boot:a' 'floppya: 1_44=a.img, status=inserted'
