This is a CocoaTemplate XCode project that exists to help get the build options
of the main VM correct for the three configurations, Debug, Assert & Release.

DOIT runs xcodebuild for each configuration and dumps the command lione for
compiling main.m into LOGD, LOGA & LOGR.  One can then compare to check what
options are produced, and what options differ.
