				Memory leaks - really?
				----------------------

Note that some developers are thinking that the ALSA library has some memory
leaks. Sure, it can be truth, but before contacting us, please, be sure that
these leaks are not forced.

The biggest reported leak is that the global configuration is cached for
next usage. If you do not want this feature, simply, call
snd_config_update_free_global() after all snd_*_open*() calls. This function
will free the cache.
