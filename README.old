Hi All,

    it gives me great pleasure to announce that the Teleplace Cog VMs are 
now available.  Huge thanks to all at Teleplace who have given me the 
opportunity to build Cog and release it as open source, been willing guinea 
pigs braving its bugs, and providing indispensable participation in getting Cog 
to its current state.  Huge thanks are also due to the original Back To The 
Future team whose VMMaker Cog extends to write the VM, and to Peter Deutsch 
from whom I've taken many ideas.

This release contains two VMs.  The Stack VM, is a cross-platform interpreter 
that uses context-to-stack mapping to achieve modest performance gains.  The 
Cog VM is a just-in-time compiler that currently supports only x86 that builds 
upon the Stack VM to achieve substantial performance improvements.  The release 
is in the form of a Monticello package containing the VMMaker source and a 
tarball containing the platform sources, the generated sources and a Squeak 4.1 
image containing the VMMaker sources.


Cog VMs:

The Cog VMs are Squeak/Croquet VMs that run closure Squeak/Croquet/Pharo/Cuis 
images. The VMs support existing plugin source but will require plugins to be 
recompiled as the VM_PROXY_MAJOR plugin api has been extended.

This release contains two distinct VMs, the StackInterpreter and the Cogit.  
The StackInterpreter is a fully-portable plug-in replacement for the current 
closure Squeak VMs and images.  The Stack VM uses context-to-stack mapping and 
a somewhat improved garbage collector to achieve modest but useful performance 
gains in the 10% to 15% range.  The StackInterpreter is intended to supersede 
the Squeak VM on platforms where the Cogit cannot be used.  The Cogit extends 
the StackInterpreter with a just-in-time compiler that uses aggressive inline 
caching techniques to deliver substantial performance gains in the 3x to 15x 
range, depending on benchmark.  The Cogit currently supports only x86 and the 
floating-point primitives and parts of the platform support code depend on 
SSE2.  I hope members of the community will attempt to port it, e.g. to ARM, 
PowerPC and x86-64.  The Cogit (excuse the pun) is so named because it is both 
an interpreter and a JIT, choosing not to generate machine code for large 
methods, interpreting them instead, the default policy being not to JIT methods 
with more than 60 literals.

The Cog VM requires a few minor image changes to pre Squeak 4.1 trunk images,
all in image/NecessaryImageChangesForCogToWork.1.cs.  The JIT's machine-code 
SmallInteger primitives insist on a SmallInteger receiver so the primitives in 
LargePositiveInteger = ~= bitAnd: bitOr: butShift: and bitXor: cannot be used 
and these methods must be deleted.  The Cogit inlines the address of the 
Character instance table, Smalltalk specialObjectsArray at: 25, into the 
machine-code at: primitive for faster ByteString>>at: and so the table cannot 
be rebuilt in SmalltalkImage>>recreateSpecialObjectsArray.  The new version 
preserves the existing table.  Both VMs maintain floats in platform order to 
ease implementation of machine code floating-point primitives, and hence 
internally are in little-endian order instead of big-endian in current Squeak 
images.  While the VMs convert float order automatically on load they do 
require special accessing primitives Float>>basicAt: & Float>>basicAt:put: that 
undo the reversal and answer Float contents in big-endian order so that e.g. 
Float>>hash is unchanged.  The methods assume these primitives can fail, 
allowing the code to be used on current Squeak VMs.

The image/VMMaker-Squeak4.1.image is a Squeak 4.1 image, runnable with the 
current Squeak VMs, that contains these changes, and can hence also be run with 
a Cog VM.  But beware, once an image has been saved on Cog it cannot be run by 
an existing Squeak VM, because existing VMs cannot undo the Float order change.
You'll fid that a Squeak 4.1 image updated to trunk will run Cog unchanged.


Platform Subsystem:

Most of the platform subsystem is unchanged but there are some important 
changes that need description.  The biggest change is the heartbeat and the 
clock in platforms/unix/vm/sqUnixHeartbeat.c and 
platforms/win32/vm/sqWin32Heartbeat.c.  The Cog VMs avoid the slow and variable 
interruptCheckCounter, folding the event check into the stack overflow check on 
frame build.  The heartbeat, typically 500Hz or 1KHz, changes the stackLimit to 
a value that will always fail.  On the next frame building send the VM will 
enter stack overflow handling that, as a side effect, will also check for 
events.  This is more efficient than the update of interruptCheckCounter and 
much more regular.  If one is running code that executes long-running 
primitives (e.g. large integer arithmetic) the counter approach will result in 
too low an interrupt check frequency, and conversely if one is running normal 
code the interrupt check frequency can be very high.

The heartbeat also maintains a 64-bit microsecond clock, UTC microseconds from 
1901, from which the backward-compatible millisecond and second clocks are 
derived.  Primitives exist to answer UTC microseconds and local microseconds.  
Updating the clock in the heartbeat results in a 1 or 2 millisecond resolution 
but avoids the cost of accessing the OS time on every prim tie which we've 
found important for performance at Teleplace.  The 64-bit microsecond clocks 
provide a unified time basis and eliminate wrapping (for the next 54,000 years 
at least).  I hope community images will move to these clocks.  It's worked 
well in VisualWorks.

Another significant change is in the external semaphore table support code.  
This is now lock-free at the cost of having to specify a maximum number of 
external semaphores at start-up (default 256).  The support code for the 
lock-free data structures are processor-specific and is currently implemented 
only for x86 and gcc-compatible compilers; see 
platforms/Cross/vm/{sqAtomicOps.h,sqMemoryFence.h}.

There is also improved crash reporting code that prints a primitive log and a C 
backtrace in addition to the Smalltalk backtrace.  See platforms/Mac 
OS/vm/sqMacMain.c, platforms/unix/vm/sqUnixMain.c, 
platforms/win32/vm/sqWin32Intel.c & platforms/win32/vm/sqWin32Backtrace.c.

Finally there is support for the QVMProfiler, a pc-sampling profiler for 
profiling at the VM level.  See platforms/unix/vm/sqUnixVMProfile.c and 
platforms/win32/vm/sqWin32VMProfile.c.  The profiler itself is in the VMMaker 
image described below in Qwaq-VMProfiling.

There are also changes to do with Teleplace-specific extensions to the 
HostWindowPlugin but these are not essential to Cog.


VMMaker and Slang:

The image/VMMaker-Squeak4.1.image Squeak 4.1 image contains the complete Cog 
VMMaker with necessary support code for simulation. This image was used to 
generate the sources in the src and stacksrc directories.

Cog's VMMaker is substantially revised and extended from the current VMMaker.  
It supports multiple classes, not just Interpreter and superclasses, because 
both context-to-stack mapping and the Cogit are too complex to write 
monolithically.  Classes can specify ancilliaryClasses and 
ancilliaryStructClasses, such as CoInterpreterStackPage, CogMethod and 
CogAbstractInstruction.  The Monticello package version is included in the 
header of all generated files and constitutes the version stamp for generated 
code.  Code is generated in sorted order so that minor changes in the Smalltalk 
source produce correspondingly minor changes in the generated code.  The 
gnuification step is built-in to VMMaker.  No effort has been made to maintain 
64-bit compatibility.  Apologies, this was unaffordable.

The VMMaker generates a single source tree used by all platforms.  Instead of 
deciding at generation time whether to use the Interpreter struct the generated 
code depends on the SQ_USE_GLOBAL_STRUCT define which can be overridden in 
platform makefiles.  All plugins live in src/plugins and platform makefiles 
along with plugins.int and plugins.ext files in the build subdirectories decide 
which plugins are built as external or internal.  The VM Generation Workspace 
from Workspace.text workspace contains dots to generate the sources.  We no 
longer use the VMMakerTool since there should be nothing platform-specific in 
the generated sources (if we add ports to other ISAs all their source can be 
included and selected as required by the platform makefiles).

Since the Cogit generates x86 machine code simulation is much more complex.  
There is a support plugin, platforms/Cross/plugins/BochsIA32Plugin that depends 
on a large simulation of the x86 family implemented in C++ (see  
processors/IA32/bochs) and on Alien.  I use the simulator frequently.  I have
tested Cog simulation in this image, running on the 
image/VMMaker-Squeak4.1.image itself.  The VM Simulation Workspace in the 
VMMaker image contains an example doit that starts the simulator. Be patient, 
even on a fast machine unhibernating the Squeak display background image takes 
nearly a minute.  I have only attempted to build and run the simulator on 
Mac OS X.  I expect Bochs can be built on linux and win32 but I have not tried. 
By the way, I've not described how to run the Bochs simulator on the current 
Squeak VM.  That's because the plugin depends on the heartbeat to break out of 
simulation occasionally via a new interpreterProxy entry point 
setInterruptCheckChain.  As this isn't supported by the current Squeak VMs the 
plugin would require modification.  So to simulate first build either of the 
Cog VMs and then run the simulation with it.

There are a number of unpublished changes to the base other than those in 
NecessaryImageChangesForCogToWork.1.cs.  This is partly laziness on my part, 
partly avoiding publishing things in advance of Cog.  These changes are better 
motivated once Cog is in use.  There are changes to the "translated primitives" 
(see implementors of translatedPrimitives) which replace messages with method 
tags for generation directives.  The Cog VMMaker uses 
Object>>perform:with:with:with:with: & 
Object>>perform:with:with:with:with:with: during simulation, and 
Collection>>#fold: & SquenceableCollection>>#copyUpThrough: during generation.  
Object>>inline: and Object var:declareC:, which are mispackaged in Kernel in 
Squeak 4.1 are obsolete (method tags being used instead) and have been removed. 
I have changed Integer>>hex and Integer>>hex8 back to their original semantics 
as of 3.8.  Backward compatibility is important and one can easily add new 
selectors if one wants different functionality.  VMMaker was here first ;)


Tarball:

The top-level directories in the tarball are

    src
        the tree for the Cog generated sources including all plugins
    stacksrc/vm
        the directory containing the Stack VM source (plugins can be 
        taken from above)
    platforms
        the usual svn platform tree but including Cog specific changes 
        such as the heartbeat
    processors
        the tree containing simulation support code, i.e. the bochs C++ x86
        simulation library, along with a potential ARM, PowerPC & MIPS
        simulator, Skeye.

    image
        the Cog-prepared Squeak 4.1 VMMaker image
    scripts
        some svn scripts to revert unchanged plugins that haven't really
        changed

    cygwinbuild
        the win32 build directory
    winbuild
        the old win32 build directory for minnow gcc 2.95.  Not entirely
        obsolete as the cygwin build as yet fails to generate a functional 
        FFIPlugin
    macbuild
        the CoreVM.xcodeproj and support build projects for Mac OS X 10.5 or
        better
    unixbuild
        the build directory for linux


Building Cog:

Each build directory above contains a HowToBuild file that describes building 
in more detail.  The build directories only contain Cogit makefiles.  If you 
want to build a Stack VM you're on your own but this is very close to the 
existing Squeak VM build.


Status:
The Cogit VM has been our sole VM at Teleplace for over a year.  We do 
occasionally find bugs, and Cog is still relatively immature.  If you find a
bug please try and create a reproducible test case and let me know.  I can't
promise to take a look or fix it but I am motivated to do so and will try my
best as time allows.  Better still if you find and fix bugs be sure to let me
know.
