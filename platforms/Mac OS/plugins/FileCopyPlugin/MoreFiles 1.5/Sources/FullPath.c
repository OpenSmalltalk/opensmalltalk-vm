/*
	IMPORTANT NOTE:
	
	The use of full pathnames is strongly discouraged. Full pathnames are
	particularly unreliable as a means of identifying files, directories
	or volumes within your application, for two primary reasons:
	
	€ 	The user can change the name of any element in the path at virtually
		any time.
	€	Volume names on the Macintosh are *not* unique. Multiple
		mounted volumes can have the same name. For this reason, the use of
		a full pathname to identify a specific volume may not produce the
		results you expect. If more than one volume has the same name and
		a full pathname is used, the File Manager currently uses the first
		mounted volume it finds with a matching name in the volume queue.
	
	In general, you should use a file¹s name, parent directory ID, and
	volume reference number to identify a file you want to open, delete,
	or otherwise manipulate.
	
	If you need to remember the location of a particular file across
	subsequent system boots, use the Alias Manager to create an alias record
	describing the file. If the Alias Manager is not available, you can save
	the file¹s name, its parent directory ID, and the name of the volume on
	which it¹s located. Although none of these methods is foolproof, they are
	much more reliable than using full pathnames to identify files.
	
	Nonetheless, it is sometimes useful to display a file¹s full pathname to
	the user. For example, a backup utility might display a list of full
	pathnames of files as it copies them onto the backup medium. Or, a
	utility might want to display a dialog box showing the full pathname of
	a file when it needs the user¹s confirmation to delete the file. No
	matter how unreliable full pathnames may be from a file-specification
	viewpoint, users understand them more readily than volume reference
	numbers or directory IDs. (Hint: Use the TruncString function from
	TextUtils.h with truncMiddle as the truncWhere argument to shorten
	full pathnames to a displayable length.)
	
	The following technique for constructing the full pathname of a file is
	intended for display purposes only. Applications that depend on any
	particular structure of a full pathname are likely to fail on alternate
	foreign file systems or under future system software versions.
