/*	¶ Make a copy of a directory structure in a new location with item filtering.
	The FilteredDirectoryCopy function makes a copy of a directory
	structure in a new location. If copyBufferPtr <> NIL, it points to
	a buffer of copyBufferSize that is used to copy files data. The
	larger the supplied buffer, the faster the copy. If
	copyBufferPtr = NIL, then this routine allocates a buffer in the
	application heap. If you pass a copy buffer to this routine, make
	its size a multiple of 512 ($200) bytes for optimum performance.
	
	The optional copyFilterProc parameter lets a routine you define
	decide what files or directories are copied to the destination.
	
	FilteredDirectoryCopy normally creates a new directory *in* the
	specified destination directory and copies the source directory's
	content into the new directory. However, if root parent directory
	(fsRtParID) is passed as the dstDirID parameter and NULL is
	passed as the dstName parameter, DirectoryCopy renames the
	destination volume to the source directory's name (truncating
	if the name is longer than 27 characters) and copies the source
	directory's content into the destination volume's root directory.
	This special case is supported by FilteredDirectoryCopy, but
	not by FSpFilteredDirectoryCopy since with FSpFilteredDirectoryCopy,
	the dstName parameter can not be NULL.
	
	srcVRefNum		input:	Source volume specification.
	srcDirID		input:	Source directory ID.
	srcName			input:	Source directory name, or nil if
							srcDirID specifies the directory.
	dstVRefNum		input:	Destination volume specification.
	dstDirID		input:	Destination directory ID.
	dstName			input:	Destination directory name, or nil if
							dstDirID specifies the directory.
	copyName		input:	Points to the new directory name if the directory
							is to be renamed or nil if the directory isn't to
							be renamed.
	copyBufferPtr	input:	Points to a buffer of copyBufferSize that
							is used the i/o buffer for the copy or
							nil if you want DirectoryCopy to allocate its
							own buffer in the application heap.
	copyBufferSize	input:	The size of the buffer pointed to
							by copyBufferPtr.
	preflight		input:	If true, DirectoryCopy makes sure there are
							enough allocation blocks on the destination
							volume to hold the directory's files before
							starting the copy.
	copyErrHandler	input:	A pointer to the routine you want called if an
							error condition is detected during the copy, or
							nil if you don't want to handle error conditions.
							If you don't handle error conditions, the first
							error will cause the copy to quit and
							DirectoryCopy will return the error.
							Error handling is recommended...
	copyFilterProc	input:	A pointer to the filter routine you want called
							for each item in the source directory, or NULL
							if you don't want to filter.
