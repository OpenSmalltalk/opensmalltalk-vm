/*	� Duplicate a file and optionally rename it.
	The FileCopy function duplicates a file and optionally renames it.
	Since the PBHCopyFile routine is only available on some
	AFP server volumes under specific conditions, this routine
	either uses PBHCopyFile, or does all of the work PBHCopyFile
	does.  The srcVRefNum, srcDirID and srcName are used to
	determine the location of the file to copy.  The dstVRefNum
	dstDirID and dstPathname are used to determine the location of
	the destination directory.  If copyName <> NIL, then it points
	to the name of the new file.  If copyBufferPtr <> NIL, it
	points to a buffer of copyBufferSize that is used to copy
	the file's data.  The larger the supplied buffer, the
	faster the copy.  If copyBufferPtr = NIL, then this routine
	allocates a buffer in the application heap. If you pass a
	copy buffer to this routine, make its size a multiple of 512
	($200) bytes for optimum performance.
	
	srcVRefNum		input:	Source volume specification.
	srcDirID		input:	Source directory ID.
	srcName			input:	Source file name.
	dstVRefNum		input:	Destination volume specification.
	dstDirID		input:	Destination directory ID.
	dstPathname		input:	Pointer to destination directory name, or
							nil when dstDirID specifies a directory.
	copyName		input:	Points to the new file name if the file is
							to be renamed or nil if the file isn't to
							be renamed.
	copyBufferPtr	input:	Points to a buffer of copyBufferSize that
							is used the i/o buffer for the copy or
							nil if you want FileCopy to allocate its
							own buffer in the application heap.
	copyBufferSize	input:	The size of the buffer pointed to
							by copyBufferPtr.
	preflight		input:	If true, FileCopy makes sure there are enough
							allocation blocks on the destination volume to
							hold both the data and resource forks before
							starting the copy.
