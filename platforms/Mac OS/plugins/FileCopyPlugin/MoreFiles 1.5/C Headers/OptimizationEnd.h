**	responsibility for its operation is 100% yours.  However, what you are
**	not permitted to do is to redistribute the source as "DSC Sample Code"
**	after having made changes. If you're going to re-distribute the source,
**	we require that you make it clear in the source that the code was
**	descended from Apple Sample Code, but that you've made changes.
**
**	The Optimization changes to MoreFiles source and header files, along with
**	this file and Optimization.h, let you optimize the code produced by MoreFiles
**	in several ways.
