Building the GdbARMPlugin
------------------------------

In the build dirctory for the platform (e.g. building/macos64x64 for 64-bit macos)
locate the gdbarm32 directory.  In that directory use the makeem script, which
invokes conf.COG, to configure and build the gdb-derived simulator for ARMv6/
ARM32.  Then build a VM that has GdbARMPlugin in its plugins.ext.
