      You are NOT ALLOWED to distribute modified versions of this file
      under its original name.  If you want to modify it and then make
      your modifications available publicly, rename the file first.
  
    This file is part of Unix Squeak.
  
    This file is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or

    You may use and/or distribute this file ONLY as part of Squeak, under
    the terms of the Squeak License as described in `LICENSE' in the base of
    this distribution, subject to the following additional restrictions:
  
    1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not
       claim that you wrote the original software.  If you use this software
       in a product, an acknowledgment to the original author(s) (and any
       other contributors mentioned herein) in the product documentation
       would be appreciated but is not required.
  
    2. You must not distribute (or make publicly available by any
       means) a modified copy of this file unless you first rename it.
  
    3. This notice must not be removed or altered in any source distribution.
  
    Using (or modifying this file for use) in any context other than Squeak
    changes these copyright conditions.  Read the file `COPYING' in the
    directory `platforms/unix/doc' before proceeding with any such use.

NOTE: Files that do not contain the above notice are subject to the
      conditions contained in the individual files themselves.  In the
      absence of explicit copyright conditions they are subject to the
      conditions described in the file `LICENSE'.

NOTE: Significant source contributions from other people are always
      acknowledged in the individual source files.  Unless explicitly
      indicated otherwise, the above copyright notice applies to such code
      (without prejudice and strictly to protect the interests of the
      individual contributors) but makes NO REPRESENTATION about the
      authorship or the ownership of the contributed code.

NOTE: Where the conditions talk about a "Squeak virtual machine" (VM)
      or use "in the context of Squeak" they refer to any program capable
      of executing a Squeak image file (as supplied in an official Squeak
      distribution) or any other image file derived from a Squeak image
      file.

You are allowed to use (or modify for use) in a program that is not a
Squeak virtual machine (VM), or to create derivative works unrelated
to the Squeak virtual machine, any files that contain the above
copyright notice subject to the following restrictions:

1. You must make a copy of the file under a different name and then use
   only your renamed copy.  [This is to prevent any confusion that
   would be caused by distributing two or more incompatible versions of
   the "same" file.]

2. You must not modify the the copyright notice in your copy, except
   as described below.

3. In your copy you must replace the portion of the copyright notice that

6. You can now use your copy in any way that you like, subject to its new

I'm sorry if the above seems draconian, but I'm trying simply to ensure
that both the Squeak and non-Squeak communities obtain the maximum benefit
from the software in this distribution.
