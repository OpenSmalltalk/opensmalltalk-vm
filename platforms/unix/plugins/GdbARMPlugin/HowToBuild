Building the GdbARMPlugin
------------------------------

Ignore this section if not using the standard Cog source tree:
Build the normal VM on your Platform. Consult Cog/{cygwinbuild|unixbuild|macbuild}/HowToBuild 
for additional information.
When generating sources, update to the latest 
versions of Cog and VMMaker.oscog.
You might want/need to change VMMaker 
class>generateSqueakCogVM to point to the right 
directories and remove FT2Plugin from the plugin-
list (even if skipped, generates a messageNotUnderstood). 
You can also change VMMaker>plugins:do: removing 
the return in the false block, in order to skip 
when a plugin is not found, instead of aborting 
the generation process.
:Ignopre preceding section if not using the standard Cog source tree.

Building on Linux
------------------------------
(so far tried on CentOS 6.5 32-bit, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32bit)

cd to the gdbarm32 buld directory under the relevant linux platform build
directory, e.g. build.linux32x86/gdbarm32.

run conf.COG

run makeem

Building on Windows
------------------------------
(so far tried with Windows 7 64bit unsing mingw/MSYS 32bit)

Besides the normal build environment, you need the package gettext.
Also, downgrade your mingwrt package to 3.20 (not 3.20-2) by unpacking
the respective -dev tarball into your mingw-folder.

When compiling the Squeak VM you need a version 3 gcc/g++. 
For configuration of gdb, you need a version 4 gcc (you don't need 
to switch g++). For switching between compilers in mingw, 
you may use 
	mingw-get install/remove gcc/gcc-v3/g++/gcc-v3-g++.

Compile gdb/bfd and gdb/opcodes with a gcc 4.*.
	cd <gdb>/bfd
	./configure --enable-targets=arm-linux
	make
	cd <gdb>/opcodes
	./configure --enable-targets=arm-linux
	make
Then switch to gcc-v3.
	cd <gdb>/bfd
	make clean && make
	cd <gdb>/opcodes
	make clean && make
	
For libsim.a, the gcc version is not important.
	cd sim/common
	./configure
	cd ../arm
	./configure && make libsim.a

Change Makefile.win32 to point to your gdb folder.
Then copy the plugin files to your svn-checkout, 
for example changing <plugin>/Makefile and running it.
Change <cog>/cygwinbuild/plugins.ext to include GdbARMPlugin.
Change to gcc 3, then build the VM (again).

Download the gdb sources (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb) and 
unpack them. Change Makefile and Makefile.unix, setting 
GDBBUILDFOLDER to the correct place.

Compile libopcodes.a:
	cd GDBBUILDFOLDER
	./configure --enable-targets=arm-linux
Making gdb takes quite some time. It may fail, as long as 
it generates <gdb>/bfd/bfd.h and <gdb>/opcodes/libopcodes.a.
	make
Compile libsim.a
	cd sim/common
	./configure
	cd ../arm
	./configure
	make
Ensure libsim.a exists in <gdb>/sim/arm.

Make the plugin which just copies the plugin-files 
to the appropriate directories. Then change 
Cog/unixbuild/bld/plugins.ext to include GdbARMPlugin.
Build the VM (again).
