Building the GdbARMv8Plugin
------------------------------

In the build dirctory for the platform (e.g. building/linux64x64 for 64-bit linux)
locate the gdbarm64 directory.  In that directory use the makeem script, which
invokes conf.COG, to configure and build the gdb-derived simulator for ARMv8/
ARM64.  Then build a VM that has GdbARMv8Plugin in its plugins.ext.
