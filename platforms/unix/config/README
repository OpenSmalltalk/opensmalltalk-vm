Assuming you know how to update these files and want to run make to make a new
configure, a word to the wise.  Do _not_ run make on eg. Mac OS X.  It will not
produce a valid configure.  Instead things will appear to work until libtool is
invoked.  libtool will go into an infinite recursion.  Instead, run make on
e.g. linux.  make configure did work on e.g. Mac OS X 10.4 but at least on 10.6
it fails.
