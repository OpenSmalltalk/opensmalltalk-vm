%description

Squeak is a full-featured implementation of the Smalltalk programming
language and environment based on (and largely compatible with) the original
Smalltalk-80 system.  Squeak has very powerful 2- and 3-D graphics, sound,
video, MIDI, animation and other multimedia capabilities -- and one of the
most impressive development environments ever created.  It also includes a
customisable framework for creating dynamic HTTP servers and interactively
extensible Web sites.  The entire Squeak system is open source software,
distributed freely with a liberal license.  See <http://Squeak.org> for
further information.

This package contains the binaries, libraries and data files needed to run
version [version] of Squeak.
