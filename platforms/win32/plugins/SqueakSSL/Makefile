# Makefile for SqueakSSL plugin.  This should work given the right versions of
# things.  Alas my current MINGW installation, 3.17, doesn't have an up-to-date
# /usr/lib/w32api/libcrypt32.a; it defines 14 funcs needed by sqWin32SSL.c but
# another 11 are undefined.
# If you want to experiment, download a suitable version of openssl,
# e.g. http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-1.0.1e.tar.gz
# and unpack it.  The below assumes it is unpacked in /usr/local.
# Then in the openssl directory do
# 	./Configure mingw
#	make
#	make test
# Then in cygwinbuild do
#	make build/vm/SqueakSSL.dll
# If you get something that works please let me know.
