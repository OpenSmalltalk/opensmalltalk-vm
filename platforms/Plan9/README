The mkfile here assumes that the B2DPlugin, FilePlugin, SocketPlugin, and
BitBltPlugin have been generated as internal plugins along with the interpreter.
It also assumes that all of this is generated under a 'src' directory, in the
same root as this README file.

So, to generate the interpreter and then build it, select the Plan9 platform in
VMMaker, and set the output as that root plus a directory called 'src':
	/path/to/platforms/Plan9/src

Then, enable the plugins which are listed above, as internal plugins.

Assuming you have a recent version of VMMaker which includes fixes for
correct code generation for Plan9, code generation should go smoothly.

Running 'mk' in this directory will generate a binary called 'interp', also in
this directory, and running this binary with the Squeak image as an argument
should start a Squeak window!
